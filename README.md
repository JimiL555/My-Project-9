# Movie Queue Manager

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of a movie queue manager using JavaScript. It demonstrates various JavaScript concepts, including arrow functions, higher-order functions like `map` and `filter`, and object methods. The application allows users to manage a movie queue by adding, removing, and displaying movies in the queue.

## Code Structure

### `index.js`

- **funnyCase Function**
  - Converts each letter in a string to the opposite case of the previous letter.
  - Example: `"You can't just do whatever you want all the time!"` becomes `"yOu cAn't jUsT Do wHaTeVeR YoU WaNt aLl tHe tImE!"`.

- **map Function**
  - A custom implementation of the `map` function that applies a callback to each element of an array.
  - Example: Doubling the numbers in an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.

- **filter Function**
  - A custom implementation of the `filter` function that filters elements of an array based on a callback.
  - Example: Filtering even numbers from an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in `[2, 4]`.

- **netflixQueue Object**
  - Manages a queue of movies with methods to watch, add, and print the queue.
  - Methods:
    - `watchMovie()`: Removes the last movie from the queue.
    - `addMovie(movie)`: Adds a new movie to the front of the queue.
    - `printQueue()`: Prints the current list of movies in the queue in reverse order.
